"""Runtime utilities for generated Python code.

This module provides control-system-agnostic utilities for reading and writing
to control systems. It's designed to be used in generated Python code and
automatically configures itself from the global config.

Usage in generated code:
    >>> from osprey.runtime import write_channel, read_channel
    >>>
    >>> # Write to control system (synchronous, like EPICS caput)
    >>> write_channel("BEAM:CURRENT", 500.0)
    >>>
    >>> # Read from control system (synchronous, like EPICS caget)
    >>> value = read_channel("BEAM:CURRENT")
    >>> print(f"Current: {value}")

Configuration:
    The runtime uses the control system configuration from the global config.yml.

Limits Validation:
    Write operations are validated at two levels:
    1. Runtime-level: An injected LimitsValidator (set by the execution wrapper)
       checks values before the connector is even called. This provides a safety
       net in subprocess execution where the connector may not be fully configured.
    2. Connector-level: The control system connector validates writes against its
       own configured limits database as a secondary check.
